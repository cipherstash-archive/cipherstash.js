# Images

Images for embedding in [README.md](/README.md).

## Files with `.drawio.png` extension

These are perfectly valid png images with a Draw.io diagram embedded in them.
They can be edited using Draw.io app, but also be rendered as a regular `.png` file by most image viewers.
This also means that they can be embedded as-is in the README, similar to regular `.png` files.
Every time the file is edited with Draw.io, the png part is kept up-to-date.
Please install the VSCode [Draw.io extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hediet.vscode-drawio) in order to edit these files locally.
