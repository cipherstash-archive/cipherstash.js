# Images

Images for embedding in [README.md](/README.md).

## Files with `.drawio.png` extension

Files in this directory have the extension `.drawio.png`.
These are perfectly valid png images with a Draw.io diagram embedded in them.
They can be edited using Draw.io app, but also embedded as-is the README, similar to regular `.png` files.
Every time the file is edited with Draw.io, the png part is kept up-to-date.
Please install the VSCode [Draw.io extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hediet.vscode-drawio) in order to edit these files.
