# ore-rs

**ore-rs:** Node bindings for [ore.rs](https://github.com/cipherstash/ore.rs).

This project was bootstrapped by [create-neon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-neon).

## Installing ore-rs

Installing ore-rs requires a [supported version of Node and Rust](https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon#platform-support).

You can install the project with npm. In the project directory, run:

```sh
$ npm install
```

This fully installs the project, including installing any dependencies and running the build.

## Building ore-rs

If you have already installed the project and only want to run the build, run:

```sh
$ npm run build
```

This command performs 2 steps:

1. It uses the [cargo-cp-artifact](https://github.com/neon-bindings/cargo-cp-artifact) utility to run the Rust build and copy the built library into `./index.node`.
2. It compiles the TypeScript code (in `src/index.ts`) with the output being stored in `dist`

## Exploring ore-rs

After building ore-rs, you can explore its exports at the TS Node REPL:

```sh
$ npm install
$ npx ts-node
> const ORE = require('.')
> import { ORE } from './src/index'
> let k1 = Buffer.from("1216a6700004fe46c5c07166025e681e", "hex")
> let k2 = Buffer.from("3f13a569d5d2c6ce8d2a85cb9e347804", "hex")
> let cipher = new ORE(k1, k2)
> let cipher = ORE.init(k1, k2)
> cipher.encrypt(100)
```

## Comparison

To compare two encrypted ciphertext values, you can use the `ORE.compare` function which returns -1, 0 or 1 if the first
operand is less-than, equal-to or greater than the second operand respectively.

Internally, this uses [cmp](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/core/cmp/trait.Ord.html#tymethod.cmp).

```typescript
let a = ore.encrypt(100)
let b = ore.encrypt(1560)
ORE.compare(a, b) // => -1
```

## Data Types

`ore-rs` can encrypt the following types:

### Number

JavaScript numbers are 64-bit floats which the underlying ORE library converts into an order-preserving integer. The
underlying value no longer represents the source number (unlike `f64::from(i)`) but guarantees ordering is preserved.

```typescript
// All valid
cipher.encrypt(456)
cipher.encrypt(3.14159)
cipher.encrypt(-100)
```

### BigInt

`BigInt` value can also be encrypted but this will throw an error if the number requires more than 64-bits of storage.
`Neon` doesn't actually support `BigInt` so the conversion is done in TypeScript using the `writeBigUInt64BE` function
(see [node.js docs](https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#bufwritebiguint64bevalue-offset]) so this will fail for negative
numbers or values larger than 2n ** 64n - 1n.

```typescript
cipher.encrypt(299792458n) // OK
cipher.encrypt(-100n) // fails!
cipher.encrypt(1180591620717411303424n) // fails!
```

### Buffer

An 8-byte buffer can be encrypted directly. If the input is not exactly 8-bytes long, the operation will fail.

```typescript
cipher.encrypt(Buffer.from([0x00, 0x12, 0x15, 0xfa, 0xcf, 0x1a, 0xdb, 0x38]) // OK
cipher.encrypt(Buffer.from([0x00, 0x12, 0x15]) // Fails!
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Installs the project, including running `npm run build`.

### `npm build`

Builds the Node addon (`index.node`) from source and compiles the TypeScript wrapper files.

Additional [`cargo build`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/commands/cargo-build.html) arguments may be passed to `npm build` and `npm build-*` commands. For example, to enable a [cargo feature](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/features.html):

```
npm run build -- --feature=beetle
```

#### `npm build-debug`

Alias for `npm build`.

#### `npm build-release`

Same as [`npm build`](#npm-build) but, builds the module with the [`release`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/profiles.html#release) profile. Release builds will compile slower, but run faster.

### `npm test`

Runs the unit tests in Rust by calling `cargo test` and in TypeScript (Jest) by calling `npx jest`.

## Project Layout

The directory structure of this project is:

```
ore-rs/
├── Cargo.toml
├── README.md
├── index.node
├── package.json
├── native/
|   └── lib.rs
├── src/
|   └── index.ts
|   └── index.test.ts
└── target/
```

### Cargo.toml

The Cargo [manifest file](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html), which informs the `cargo` command.

### README.md

This file.

### index.node

The Node addon—i.e., a binary Node module—generated by building the project. This is the main module for this package, as dictated by the `"main"` key in `package.json`.

Under the hood, a [Node addon](https://nodejs.org/api/addons.html) is a [dynamically-linked shared object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_(computing)#Shared_libraries). The `"build"` script produces this file by copying it from within the `target/` directory, which is where the Rust build produces the shared object.

### package.json

The npm [manifest file](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/configuring-npm/package-json), which informs the `npm` command.

### native/

The directory tree containing the Rust source code for the project.

### native/lib.rs

The Rust library's main module.

### src/

TypeScript wrapper files - clients call this code rather than calling the functions in `index.node` directly.

### target/

Binary artifacts generated by the Rust build.
