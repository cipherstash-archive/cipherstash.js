Thursday
- Added schema builder
- Collection manager to create and drop collections based on the schema

Next
- Add an reindex function to collection manager
- Wrap typeorm-encrypted
- Create a wrapper Repository type which decorates the findBy etc methods
- Work out how to handle all the different types of errors from Stashjs - they're all nested JSON from gRPC (we should have a humanError function)


Console
- It would be really handy to see my list of collections in console!
